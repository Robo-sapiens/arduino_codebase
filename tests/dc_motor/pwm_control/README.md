# PWM control

### Description:

Arduino connects to the DC motor through the driver and drives it, changing the rotation speed using pwm (Pulse-Width Modulation).

### Expected behaviour:

- Motor rotates for 2 seconds with 1/4 part of voltage
- Motor rotates for 2 seconds with 1/2 part of voltage
- Motor rotates for 2 seconds with full voltage
- Motor stops for 2 seconds
- The motor rotates in the other direction repeating all the steps above
